Spark-GPU
============

The purpose of this project is to investigate the performance gains from GPU acceleration 
of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org).
A few applications, namely WordCount, KMeans-Clustering, and Floating-point Sorting 
are evaluated. In addition a number GPU-compatible functions for Spark's Resilient Distributed 
Datasets (RDD) have been implemented.
